This is a simple app created at Railscamp Perth 2010

What does it do?
=================
It automates the creation of HTML email signatures (which are a necessary evil where I work).


Why does it exist?
=================
Outlook + MS Word's HTML rendering engine creates terrible markup that causes bugs with our recruitment system. As a result, I had to hand create each signature to ensure it has standards compliant markup. 


How can I use it?
=================
Customise the output.erb file to suit your signature.
